## Usage

[Video Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IB3QckxaAtxahzu_V5BC2d_Dz4AEIKik/view?usp=sharing)

This is the back end API only, so you will need to use a desktop API client like Insomnia Core to test the routes yourself. You will also need to have MongoDB installed. For A video demonstration, use the link above.
